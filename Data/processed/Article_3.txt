Brazil’s reigning surfing world champion Filipe Toledo has announced he is taking a one-year mental health break from competition.The 28-year-old, who won the World Surf League championship in 2022 and 2023, joins fellow big names in Australia’s Stephanie Gilmore and Hawaiian Carissa Moore in taking the year off.Toledo competed in the opening contest in Hawaii, but withdrew from the Pipe Pro after just two waves in the opening heat, citing food poisoning.However, some critics linked the aerial specialist’s absence to his dislike of big, barrelling waves.With the second stop at nearby Sunset Beach getting under way this week, Toledo says he needs some time out.The first Brazilian surfer to claim back-to-back world titles, Toledo has won 17 titles on the Championship Tour since joining in 2013 at the age of 17.“In the past, I have been honest about some of my challenges not only with injuries but also with mental health,” Toledo said in a statement.“Competing at the highest level for the past decade has taken a toll on me and I need a break to recover for the next chapter of my career.“I have so much passion for the sport, but I need some time off to fully recover so I can come back stronger than ever.“I hope my fans around the world understand this decision and will stick with me when I return to the tour next year.”Toledo has been granted a wildcard to compete in the World Surf League’s 2025 season, and has already qualified for the Brazilian team for the Paris Olympics, although he didn’t address whether he planned to compete.“This decision has been so hard for me to make, and it comes after days of discussion with those closest to me,” Toledo said in a social media post announcing the decision.“The WSL has been very supportive, and I am very grateful that they have granted me the wildcard for the start of the 2025 season. I am committed to coming back better than ever.”Morocco’s Ramzi Boukhiam, who upset Australia’s defending champion Jack Robinson at the Pipe Pro, will take Toledo’s place in the Championship Tour field.
